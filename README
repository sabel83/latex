The goal was creating an easy to use (and re-use) tool for writing documentation
and presentation in Latex. The target operating systems were GNU/Linux based
systems, however it should work on all Unix based systems. Might work on
Windows as well.

It makes heavy use of the GNU Make utility: the whole solution consists of a
Makefile making it easy to deploy and use.
